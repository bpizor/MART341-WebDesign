1. forms normally serve the purpose of gaining information for the server.
2. text boxes allow users to add to the server, selections allow answers to questions and submit buttons can allow them to subscribe to the page.
3. This weeks work was more time consuming than normal, due to the amount of information needed to get tables and forms in place. I went through the weeks lesson on monday and took notes. On tuesday I sat down and did the homework.
