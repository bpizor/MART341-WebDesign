  <h2> Step 1: Modern Ingredients  <h2>
    1. Grevillea foliage - x 1 bunches
2. Heavenly Bamboo - x 1 branch
3. Leucadendron - x 5
4. Dried Bougainvillea - x 1 branch
5. Earth Star (bromeliad) - x 1 in a 2 1/2 inch pot
6. Pin Cushion flowers - x 2
7. Poppy pods - x 6
8. Redwood (sequoia sempervirens) sprigs - x 1 bunch

*Quantities listed above are for one wreath made on an 8" wreath frame. If you'd like to make a bigger wreath, buy a larger wire frame, up the greens quantities accordingly and follow the same instructions as for the 8".

If you have trouble finding the above from your local nursery or florist, choose things you're drawn to. Just make sure you have a variety of colors and shapes/sizes - at least two different smallish spriggy greens and a few hardy flower/succulent/bromeliads (something that will last and keep looking good out of water or is dried).
<h3> Step 2: Prep Your Greens </h3>
Cut your greens and flowers into 7-8 inch sections (each one including a tip) and pile them separately and neatly on your work table.
<h4> Step 3: Get Wired  </h4>
To make your wreath you'll need:

- one 8" wreath ring
- gardening shears
- 24 gauge / 1/4 lb paddle wire
- wire cutters

To get started, tie your wire to where the outside ring meets one of the cross pieces by wrapping the wire around two to three times and twisting it like a twist tie.

NOTE: You will be leaving the wire on the spool the whole time. You will not be cutting the spool off until the very end.

<h5> Step 4: Get Your Greens On </h5
  Start by laying down a small bunch of one of your greens, as illustrated in the first photo above. Add a few more sprigs of the other green on top of the first bunch.
  <h6> Step 5: Wrap Your Wire </h6>
  Now you're going to take your spool of wire and wrap it across the greens, down through the wire frame center hole, across the underside and back up to the starting point. Pull the wire tight. Repeat this wrap two - three more times.
  <h7>  Step 6: Place, Wrap, and Repeat</h7>
      </body>You're going to repeat the last step again and again, layering all the different goodies and wire wrapping every few bunches. Look to the images as 'pattern maps', aka placement guides. There's no rules to the order of how you layer the greens, so don't stress about making it exactly like the one pictured. I would just say try and place the color pops (flowers, etc.) at intervals all the way around so it looks balanced.
