  Be intentional about who you are, how you treat yourself and others, adn how yiu spend your days. Take time periodically to truly slow it all down and listen to your breath. Use those minutes or hours to remember that you have everything you need in this very monment,  that everything is okay jsut as it is now. Allow yourself everything you are feeling right now, whether its joy or hurt, sorror or glee. And then, return to **this** moment. Remin yourself where you come from and who you are. Remember that whether you're floating through busy days or stumbling through tough times, you are a living, breathign being with real feelings and real dreams. Remind yourself that you are meant to feel joy; you are meant to feel free.
