Basically everything I learned this semester was new to me. I never really took the time to think about all the work that is put into the pages I look at everyday.
I learned that there are certain fonts made specifically for the web.
I had a lot to learn this semester. I struggled mainly trying to understand how piece fit together. This was like trying to learn a new language in a distant country, very difficult but slowly builds overtime.
