divisions help us control how content looks in a group rather than element-by-element. The ID attribute takes as its value a string, which should be a unique identifier to that specific element. The class attribute groups similar types of elements together by using the same name value. Spans work like divs, but serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.
One advantage is they are there for you to use, and it makes it easier when adding it to your page. A disadvantage is that you now have to rely on another page to do what you need it to.
I was challenged with a lot. I struggle to understand everything when it comes to web design, but working through the lessons little by little and taking LOTS of notes has helped.
