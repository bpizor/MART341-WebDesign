    <h2> Lyrics </h2>

    [Intro: Scott Beardsley & Dylan Fipps]
Maybe I'm not the one to blame 'cause I
Fell apart when you turned away
So now I'm knock-knock-knockin' at your front door
Because there's gotta be a way to fix this
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Scott Beardsley]
Do you remember when?
Back when we were kids
And the hardest part was just fighting back the tears
We were young and dumb but we never meant for this
So now my heart's ripped out
My head spins around
For all the times you filled my broken mind with doubt
It's not over now when all you do is shut me out

[Pre-Chorus: Scott Beardsley]
But now I know
It's better just to let you go

[Chorus: Scott Beardsley & Dylan Fipps]
Maybe I'm not the one to blame 'cause I
Fell apart when you turned away
So now I'm knock-knock-knockin' at your front door
Because there's gotta be a way to fix this like before
Maybe I'm not the reason you're mad
Guess what!
It's not my fault that your life's just bad
So now I've lost the words to say
'Cause life gets hard when all you are is the mistake

[Verse 2: Scott Beardsley & Dylan Fipps]
I know
I'm better off
But now there's times left wasted to yesterday
When all you did was cut me off
So now I know
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fair!
When all that was placed in front of me
Was someone who doesn't care

[Breakdown: Dylan Fipps]
I'd wash away
All the mistakes that made you turn from me
But I'm just a fiend
So you judge someone who can't be free

[Chorus: Scott Beardsley & Dylan Fipps]
Maybe I'm not the one to blame 'cause I
Fell apart when you turned away
So now I'm knock-knock-knockin' at your front door
Because there's gotta be a way to fix this like before
Maybe I'm not the reason you're mad
Guess what!
It's not my fault that your life's just bad
So now I've lost the words to say
'Cause life gets hard when all you are is the mistake

[Bridge]
(T-minus five... four... three... two... one... liftoff, we have liftoff.)

[Breakdown: Dylan Fipps]
I wish there was a way around this
In a way, just know that you gave up on me
This isn't time for your repentance
You're ignorant and cruel, face facts, get back, just leave

Bleck!

You're nothing but a mistake!

[Chorus: Scott Beardsley & Dylan Fipps, both]
Maybe I'm not the one to blame 'cause I
Fell apart when you turned away
So now I'm knock-knock-knockin' at your front door
Because there's gotta be a way to fix this like before
Maybe I'm not the reason you're mad
Guess what!
It's not my fault that your life's just bad
So now I've lost the words to say
'Cause life gets hard when all you are is the mistake
'Cause life gets hard when all you are is the mistake
