    <p>In You Are Special, Max Lucado tells the story of Punchinello, the wooden Wemmick who believes that he isn't good enough because of what others say about him. When will Punchinello realize how truly special he is? You Are Special is a beautiful story that reminds us that we are precious to God just the way we are.</p>
